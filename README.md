# A-simple-shell
Implementing a shell program that displays a prompt, manages the PATH variable, launches executables based on relative or absolute paths, implements a history feature, and handles special characters and redirections. handling environment variables, implement built-in commands, and handling signals such as ctrl-C. i tried too implementing features such as &&, ||, parenthesis, wildcards, and piping output between processes.using functions such as readline(), execve(), and glob() to read input, execute commands, and expand wildcards.
